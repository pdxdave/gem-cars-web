      <p>For over 40 years I have been buying, collecting, trading and selling cars. Over that time I have collected a lot of parts 
        for various projects; some got off the ground, while others didn't.  It's time to thin 
        the herd.  All of the listed items have been garaged since I purchased them.
      </p>

      <p>
        How this will work.  Each listed item will have a contact link. If you're interested in a 
        particular part, you can click on the contact link, send me your name, phone number, and location 
        and I'll get back to you.  
      </p>
        <p>Payment. I've given this much thought and have decided to stay away from Paypal.  Yeah, 
        I know they're popular, but I don't want to pay their fees. Instead, I'm going to use  
        <a href="https://www.zellepay.com/"> ZELLE</a>. Click on the link and read about their service.
        It's fast and easy.
        </p>

        <p>Shipping.  For those outside of Portland, and shipping is involved, I will get the shipping costs and let 
          you know what they come to.  For those that are local, I will offer a 10% discount for picking up the parts, otherwise
          shipping costs will be applied.
